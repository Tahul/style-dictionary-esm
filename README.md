> This package is currently work in progress, the list above describe what it aims to do.
---

An ESM-ready version of [Style Dictionary](https://github.com/amzn/style-dictionary).

- **100%** test suite from original repo
- Full **ESM-compatible** rewrite
- Easily disable FS dependency
- **PNPM**, **Vite** and **Vitest** for the repository

## Install

```bash
npm i style-dictionary-light
```

## Why

Loving Design Tokens and the Style Dictionary API.

I wanted to use it inside multiple projects, that needs to run in workers.

# Future

If [Style Dictionary 4](https://github.com/amzn/style-dictionary/issues/643) marks ESM-support as a step of their roadmap, I'll happily give help and deprecate this repository!

Otherwise, I will continue to maintain it.
